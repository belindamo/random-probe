# Experiment Ideas

This section outlines rigorous experiments designed to validate the Random Probe method's core bit flip: **direct enforcement of distributional conformity through random projections is superior to standard ELBO optimization alone**.

## Core Research Questions

Based on our literature review and research concept, we need to test several key hypotheses:

1. **Distributional Conformity**: Does the Random Probe method achieve better posterior-prior distributional matching than standard VAEs?
2. **Generation Quality**: Do RP-enhanced VAEs produce higher quality samples with better latent space utilization?
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Can the RP method provide these benefits without significant computational overhead?
4. **Generalizability**: Does the method work across different VAE architectures and datasets?

## Experiment 1: Core Random Probe Validation

**Thesis Statement**: Random Probe VAEs achieve significantly better distributional conformity than standard VAEs while maintaining or improving generation quality.

**Testable Hypotheses**:
- H1: RP-VAE latent distributions will show lower KL divergence from N(0,I) than standard VAE
- H2: RP-VAE will achieve better FID scores on standard image benchmarks
- H3: RP-VAE will demonstrate improved latent space utilization (higher active units)

**Bit Flip Being Tested**: Standard ELBO optimization ensures adequate posterior-prior conformity → Direct projection-based enforcement required

**Experimental Design**:
- **Independent Variables**: 
  - Model type: Standard VAE vs RP-VAE
  - RP weight λ: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
  - Number of random projections per batch: [1, 3, 5]
- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Distributional conformity: KL(q(z|x)||N(0,I)), MMD distance
  - Generation quality: FID, IS, LPIPS
  - Latent utilization: Active units, mutual information
  - Training dynamics: Loss curves, convergence time

**Datasets**: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA-64
**Baseline Models**: Standard VAE, β-VAE (β=1.5, 4.0), WAE-MMD

**Evaluation Protocol**:
1. Train all models for 100 epochs with identical architectures
2. Measure distributional conformity using:
   - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on each latent dimension
   - Maximum Mean Discrepancy with RBF kernel
   - Wasserstein-2 distance estimation
3. Evaluate generation quality on 10K generated samples
4. Compute statistical significance using paired t-tests

**Success Criteria**: RP-VAE achieves ≥20% improvement in distributional metrics with FID scores within 5% of baseline

## Experiment 2: Distributional Conformity Deep Dive

**Thesis Statement**: Random projections provide a more accurate and efficient method for measuring and enforcing distributional conformity than existing approaches.

**Testable Hypotheses**:
- H1: RP-based conformity measurement correlates strongly with ground-truth distributional distances
- H2: RP enforcement prevents posterior collapse more effectively than β-VAE regularization
- H3: Multiple random projections provide better conformity than single projections

**Experimental Tasks**:
1. **Conformity Measurement Validation**:
   - Compare RP-estimated MMD vs true MMD on synthetic datasets
   - Vary dimension k=[2,4,8,16,32] and number of projections n=[1,5,10,20]
   - Measure correlation between RP estimates and ground truth

2. **Posterior Collapse Prevention**:
   - Track active units over training with different regularization methods
   - Measure mutual information I(x,z) throughout training
   - Compare RP vs β-VAE vs standard VAE on collapsing datasets

**Independent Variables**: Regularization method, latent dimension, projection count
**Dependent Variables**: Estimation accuracy, active units, mutual information

**Validity Threats & Mitigations**:
- **Threat**: Synthetic data may not reflect real-world behavior
- **Mitigation**: Include both synthetic and real datasets with known properties
- **Threat**: Random projection quality may vary significantly
- **Mitigation**: Use multiple random seeds and report confidence intervals

## Experiment 3: Computational Efficiency Analysis

**Thesis Statement**: The Random Probe method provides distributional benefits with minimal computational overhead compared to alternative approaches.

**Testable Hypotheses**:
- H1: RP overhead is <5% of total training time
- H2: RP method scales better than normalizing flow-based approaches
- H3: Memory usage increase is negligible

**Experimental Procedure**:
1. **Timing Analysis**:
   - Measure forward/backward pass times with/without RP
   - Profile GPU memory usage during training
   - Compare against WAE-MMD, β-VAE, Flow-VAE

2. **Scalability Study**:
   - Test on varying batch sizes: [32, 64, 128, 256]
   - Test on varying latent dimensions: [16, 32, 64, 128]
   - Measure wall-clock training time for fixed epochs

**Resources Required**:
- GPU cluster with consistent hardware (A100 GPUs)
- Memory profiling tools
- Statistical analysis framework

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (1 week implementation, 1 week experimentation)

## Experiment 4: Random Projection Ablation Study

**Thesis Statement**: The effectiveness of Random Probe method depends on the number and frequency of random projections in a predictable manner.

**Key Questions**:
- What is the optimal number of projections per batch?
- How does projection frequency affect convergence?
- Is there a diminishing returns threshold?

**Experimental Matrix**:
- Projections per batch: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10]
- Projection frequency: [every batch, every 2nd, every 5th]
- RP weight schedule: [constant, annealing, adaptive]

**Analysis Plan**:
- Plot performance curves vs projection parameters
- Identify optimal operating points for different compute budgets
- Develop guidelines for hyperparameter selection

## Experiment 5: Architecture Generalizability

**Thesis Statement**: Random Probe method generalizes across different VAE architectures and modalities without architecture-specific modifications.

**Test Architectures**:
- Convolutional VAE (images)
- Linear VAE (tabular data) 
- Hierarchical VAE (β-TCVAE)
- Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE)

**Test Modalities**:
- Images: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA
- Text: Penn Treebank (with learned embeddings)
- Tabular: UCI ML datasets

**Success Metrics**:
- Consistent improvement across all architectures
- No degradation in modality-specific performance
- Minimal hyperparameter tuning required

## Experiment 6: MMD Connection Validation

**Thesis Statement**: The Random Probe method approximates Maximum Mean Discrepancy through random linear functionals, providing theoretical grounding for its effectiveness.

**Theoretical Validation**:
1. **Convergence Study**: Show that RP estimates converge to true MMD as number of projections increases
2. **Kernel Connection**: Demonstrate relationship between RP and specific MMD kernels
3. **Sample Complexity**: Establish bounds on required projections for ε-approximation

**Empirical Tests**:
- Compare RP-VAE performance to explicit MMD-VAE
- Analyze kernel matrices induced by random projections
- Study convergence rates on synthetic distributions
