# Alternative Autoencoder Methods: WAE, AAE, and Variants

This section analyzes alternatives to traditional VAE approaches that address distributional constraints through different regularization strategies.

## 1. Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (WAE) (2017)

### Problem
Traditional VAEs use KL divergence for regularization, which can be restrictive and lead to posterior collapse. Need for more flexible regularization that better matches encoded distribution to prior.

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- KL divergence is the optimal choice for posterior regularization in autoencoders
- Variational inference framework is necessary for principled autoencoder training
- GAN-style training cannot be effectively combined with autoencoder architectures

### Key Insight
Replace KL regularization with Wasserstein distance minimization between encoded training distribution and prior, providing more flexible and theoretically grounded regularization.

### Technical Approach
- Minimizes penalized Wasserstein distance between model and target distributions
- Two variants: WAE-MMD (using Maximum Mean Discrepancy) and WAE-GAN (using adversarial discriminator)
- Generalizes adversarial autoencoders (AAE) as special case
- Maintains encoder-decoder architecture with stable training

### Evaluation
- Showed better sample quality than VAEs measured by FID score
- Maintained stability and nice latent manifold structure of VAEs
- Demonstrated superior generation quality while preserving VAE benefits

### Impact
Influential work that established Wasserstein distance as viable alternative to KL divergence, spawning multiple follow-up methods and providing theoretical foundation for non-KL autoencoder regularization.

## 2. Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE) (2015)

### Problem
Standard autoencoders lack principled way to impose priors on latent representations, and traditional regularization methods are limited to specific prior distributions (typically Gaussian).

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- Autoencoder latent spaces naturally follow meaningful distributions
- Explicit regularization isn't necessary for useful representations
- Prior distributions must be analytically tractable for effective regularization

### Key Insight
Use adversarial training to match aggregated posterior of autoencoder's latent code to arbitrary prior distribution, ensuring no "holes" in prior space and meaningful sampling from any part of prior.

### Technical Approach
- Combines autoencoder with discriminator network that distinguishes latent codes from prior samples
- Adversarial loss encourages encoder to produce latent codes indistinguishable from prior
- Can impose arbitrary priors (not limited to Gaussian)
- Enables disentangling of style and content

### Evaluation
- Demonstrated competitive generative performance on MNIST, SVHN, and Toronto Face datasets
- Showed ability to disentangle style and content in images
- Achieved meaningful latent space traversals

### Impact
Pioneered adversarial regularization in autoencoders, establishing foundation for later methods like WAE and providing practical framework for arbitrary prior imposition.

## 3. Adversarially Regularized Autoencoders (ARAE) (2017)

### Problem
Applying deep latent variable models to discrete structures (text sequences, discretized images) is challenging, particularly for controllable generation and style transfer tasks.

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- VAE/AAE frameworks directly applicable to discrete sequences
- Learned priors don't need special consideration for discrete structures
- Text generation doesn't require specialized autoencoder architectures

### Key Insight
Extend Wasserstein autoencoder framework to discrete sequences with learned priors targeting controllable representation, enabling natural textual outputs and latent space manipulations.

### Technical Approach
- Builds on WAE framework for discrete structures
- Explores different learned priors for controllable representation
- Enables unaligned textual style transfer through latent manipulations
- Combines adversarial regularization with sequence modeling

### Evaluation
- Demonstrated natural textual outputs and effective latent space manipulations
- Showed improvements in automatic and human evaluation for style transfer
- Outperformed existing methods in unaligned style transfer tasks

### Impact
Extended adversarial autoencoder concepts to NLP, establishing foundation for controllable text generation and demonstrating versatility of adversarial regularization across modalities.

## 4. Stacked Wasserstein Autoencoder (SWAE) (2019)

### Problem
Single-stage WAE approaches are limited in their ability to learn complex hierarchical representations, and simple explicit priors may be insufficient for capturing complex data distributions.

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- Single-stage autoencoder architectures sufficient for complex data
- Simple explicit priors (Gaussian) adequate for all applications
- Optimal transport constraints must be enforced strictly at single level

### Key Insight
Create hierarchical model that relaxes optimal transport constraints at two stages: first learning flexible representation distribution (encoded prior), then approximating it with latent variable model under regularization.

### Technical Approach
- Two-stage hierarchical architecture
- First stage: learns flexible encoded prior distribution
- Second stage: approximates encoded prior with latent variable model
- Relaxed optimal transport constraints enable more complex representations
- Maintains stability while improving representation capacity

### Evaluation
- Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art in faithful reconstruction and generation quality
- Demonstrated on both quantitative and qualitative metrics
- Showed improved handling of complex data distributions

### Impact
Demonstrated that hierarchical approaches can improve upon single-stage methods, influencing subsequent work on multi-stage generative models and hierarchical representation learning.

## 5. Wasserstein-Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (WWAE) (2019)

### Problem
VAEs suffer from blurriness issues and GANs have training instability. Need method that addresses both optimal transport for prior matching and efficient computation without sampling burden.

### Prior Assumptions in Literature
- Single Wasserstein distance sufficient for autoencoder regularization
- Sampling-based methods necessary for optimal transport computation
- Cannot leverage closed-form solutions for Wasserstein distances

### Key Insight
Utilize closed-form squared Wasserstein-2 distance for Gaussians in optimization, recognizing both prior and aggregated posterior can be well-captured by Gaussians, eliminating sampling burden.

### Technical Approach
- Formulated as minimization of penalized optimal transport
- Leverages closed-form Wasserstein-2 distance for two Gaussians
- Uses reparameterization trick for computational efficiency
- Avoids sampling burden while maintaining theoretical foundations

### Evaluation
- Better latent structures than VAEs
- Higher visual quality and FID scores than VAEs and GANs
- Demonstrated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CelebA

### Impact
Showed that analytical solutions can replace sampling-based approaches in optimal transport, providing computationally efficient alternative while maintaining theoretical rigor.
